## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Reinforcement Learning is teaching a software agent how to behave in an environmet by telling it how good it's doing.

## Deep Q Learning
This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network to predict the actions.

## Note
### Model (PyTorch)
Linear_QNet(DQN) --> It is a feed forward neural network
